# S.M.A.R.T. Monitoring

Beszel parses S.M.A.R.T. data from `smartctl` and displays it on the system page if available. This usually requires increased permissions.

On Linux, Beszel also reports eMMC wear/EOL indicators and mdraid array health.

## Requirements

The minimum supported `smartctl` version is 7.0.

To make sure your system is compatible, install `smartmontools` on the agent machine, check your version, and scan for devices: {#install}

::: code-group

```bash [Debian/Ubuntu]
sudo apt install smartmontools
```

```bash [Fedora]
sudo dnf install smartmontools
```

```bash [Arch]
sudo pacman -S smartmontools
```

```bash [FreeBSD]
pkg install smartmontools
```

```bash [macOS]
brew install smartmontools
```

:::

```bash
smartctl -v | head -1
```

```bash
sudo smartctl --scan
```


## Docker agent

Switch to the `:alpine` image and add the following to your `docker-compose.yml`. Make sure to replace the device names with your actual devices.

> Non-base images like `beszel-agent-intel` and `beszel-agent-nvidia` also work and don't require `:alpine`.

```yaml
beszel-agent:
  image: henrygd/beszel-agent:alpine
  devices:
    - /dev/sda:/dev/sda
    - /dev/nvme0:/dev/nvme0
  cap_add:
    - SYS_RAWIO # required for S.M.A.R.T. data
    - SYS_ADMIN # required for NVMe S.M.A.R.T. data
```

::: tip Pass in the base controller name, not the block / partition

Note that we are using `sda` and `nvme0` in our example, not `sda1` or `nvme0n1`.

:::

::: warning Some NVMe drives require mapping to the partition

Some drive manufacturers (e.g., Intel) require mapping the host partition to the controller name for S.M.A.R.T. data to work properly. If you see missing capacity information or other issues, try:

```yaml
devices:
  - /dev/nvme0n1:/dev/nvme0
```

See [issue #1637](https://github.com/henrygd/beszel/issues/1637) for more details.

## Binary agent

Make sure `smartctl` is installed by following the [installation instructions](#install).

`smartctl` needs elevated privileges to talk to disks:

- SATA/ATA via SG_IO requires `CAP_SYS_RAWIO`
- NVMe admin passthrough requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`

### Recommended: systemd ambient capabilities

If you run the agent as a systemd service, add capabilities to the service instead of the process running as root.

1. Edit your service file (for example `/etc/systemd/system/beszel-agent.service`) and add the following under `[Service]`:

```ini
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_SYS_RAWIO CAP_SYS_ADMIN
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_SYS_RAWIO CAP_SYS_ADMIN
```

2. If you have existing `DeviceAllow` lines in your service file (for Nvidia GPUs, for example), you must also add `DeviceAllow` rules for your drives:

```ini
DeviceAllow=/dev/sda r
DeviceAllow=/dev/nvme0 r
```

3. Reload and restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart beszel-agent
```

If this doesn't work, try [adding the `beszel` user to the `disk` group](#disk-group).

### Alternative: file capabilities on smartctl

If you don't use systemd or prefer not to change the service, you can add the needed capabilities to the `smartctl` binary and restrict execution to a dedicated group. This lets the agent user run `smartctl` with just the required privileges.

```bash
# grant capabilities required for SATA (RAWIO) and NVMe (SYS_ADMIN)
sudo setcap cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_admin+ep "$(command -v smartctl)"

# optionally restrict execution to a dedicated group
sudo groupadd -r smartctl 2>/dev/null || true
sudo chgrp smartctl "$(command -v smartctl)"
sudo chmod 750 "$(command -v smartctl)"

# add the beszel service user to that group
sudo usermod -aG smartctl beszel
```

Then restart the agent. Note: If your systemd unit sets `NoNewPrivileges=yes`, file capabilities added to `smartctl` will not be usable by the agent.

### FreeBSD

Add the agent user to the `operator` group so it can access disk devices:

```sh
pw groupmod operator -m beszel
service beszel-agent restart
```

### Verify permissions

Test that `smartctl` works without sudo for the agent user:

```bash
sudo -u beszel smartctl -H /dev/sda
sudo -u beszel smartctl -H /dev/nvme0
```

If these commands succeed, the agent will be able to parse S.M.A.R.T. data.

## Windows

As of 0.16.0, `smartctl` is included in the Windows agent package.

If it's not working properly, you can follow our previous guide to install `smartmontools` manually:

Download and install `smartmontools` from the official SourceForge page:

1. Go to [https://sourceforge.net/projects/smartmontools/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smartmontools/files/)
2. Download the latest Windows installer (`.exe` file)
3. Run the installer as Administrator
4. Follow the installation wizard to complete the setup

After installation, verify that `smartctl` is accessible from the command line:

```cmd
smartctl --version
```

### Adding smartctl to PATH

::: details Click to expand/collapse

If your system cannot find the `smartctl` executable, you will need to manually add the smartmontools installation directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

To add smartctl to your PATH:

1. Open the **Edit the system environment variables** dialog:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, press Enter and go the Advanced tab.
   - Or search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu

2. Click **Environment Variables...**

3. In the **System variables** section, select **Path** and click **Edit...**

4. Click **New** and add the smartmontools installation directory:

   ```
   C:\Program Files\smartmontools\bin
   ```

   ::: tip Installation path may vary
   The exact path depends on your installation location.

5. Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and verify the installation:

   ```cmd
   smartctl --version
   ```

:::

### Scan for devices

Once `smartctl` is working, scan for available devices:

```cmd
smartctl --scan
```

The agent should now be able to collect S.M.A.R.T. data from your Windows system.

## Troubleshooting

### Commands still require sudo despite capabilities being set

If `smartctl` still fails even after setting capabilities (via systemd ambient capabilities or file capabilities), the issue is likely device permissions. Even with `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, the user needs read access to the device files themselves.

Check your device permissions:

```bash
ls -l /dev/sda /dev/nvme0
```

You'll typically see something like:

```
brw-rw---- root disk /dev/sda      # block device, group readable
crw------- root root /dev/nvme0    # char device, only root can read
```

#### Add user to disk group {#disk-group}

Most Linux distributions have a `disk` group that provides access to disk devices. Add the beszel user to this group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG disk beszel
sudo systemctl restart beszel-agent
```

::: tip Note for NVMe devices
Some systems set NVMe character devices (`/dev/nvme0`) to mode `600` (owner-only), even if SATA devices work fine with the `disk` group. If NVMe S.M.A.R.T. still doesn't work after adding the user to the `disk` group, see the solution below.
:::

#### Adjust NVMe device permissions

If your NVMe devices are still inaccessible after adding the user to the `disk` group, you can adjust the device group to `disk`.

```bash
# Check current permissions
ls -l /dev/nvme0

# Create a udev rule that changes NVMe devices to disk group ownership
sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-smartctl-disk-group.rules > /dev/null << 'EOF'
# Change NVMe devices to disk group ownership for S.M.A.R.T. monitoring
KERNEL=="nvme[0-9]*", GROUP="disk", MODE="0660"
EOF

# Reload udev rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger

# Verify the new permissions (should show disk group and 660 mode)
ls -l /dev/nvme0

# Restart the agent
sudo systemctl restart beszel-agent
```

This changes the group ownership to `disk` and the mode to `0660` (group-readable).

::: warning Potential conflicts
If other software on your system has created udev rules for the same devices, there may be conflicts. You can check for existing rules with:

```bash
grep -r "KERNEL.*nvme" /etc/udev/rules.d/
```

:::

To remove the udev rule:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/99-smartctl-disk-group.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

## Alerts

If at least one notification channel is configured and disks report S.M.A.R.T. data to Beszel, a failure automatically triggers a notification. This behaviour is not currently configurable. 

Note that if a drive is already reporting failure on first detection by the Beszel agent, no alert will fire.
